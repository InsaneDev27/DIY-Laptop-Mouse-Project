# DIY-Laptop-Mouse-Project
The Laptop Mouse Project is a DIY fix to discomfort caused by prolonged use of laptop track-pads. The LMP offers an ergonomic alternative to a typical mouse or track-pad, and secures to the sides of laptops for stability and comfort. It is mostly 3-D printable and all electronics can be found online.
