# DIY-Laptop-Mouse-Project
The Laptop Mouse Project is a DIY fix to discomfort caused by prolonged use of laptop track-pads. The LMP offers an ergonomic alternative to a typical mouse or track-pad, and secures to the sides of laptops for stability and comfort. It is mostly 3-D printable and all electronics can be found online.

(maybe outsource to thingiverse?)

3-D Printing Notes:
(settings / fuzzy skin)
(SCREW MUST BE PRINTED SOLID)
(Scroll-Wheel troubles with FDM, what I did to work around this)
(fitment is not universal, some post-processing and fitment adjusting necessary)
